## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Prathmesh Bhoyar** 👋  

🚀 **Aspiring AI Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Automation & Systems Enthusiast**  
💡 I focus on building **practical, real-world software systems** with strong emphasis on **performance, scalability, clean architecture, and developer experience**.

I enjoy working close to the system layer — automating workflows, designing backend services, and creating tools that feel *useful*, *maintainable*, and *production-ready*.

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

- Write clean, readable, and scalable code.
- Prefer simplicity over unnecessary complexity.
- Build things that solve real problems  
- Stay consistent and improve incrementally  
- Learn by building, breaking, and refining  

> I believe good engineers are built through **discipline, curiosity, and long-term consistency**.
